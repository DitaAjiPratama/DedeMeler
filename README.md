# DedeMeler

Debian Desktop Mein Installer. My personal fav apps installer.

When I had to reinstall my GNU/Linux OS, re-install my fav apps list is wasting the time. Sometimes, I forgetting some apps on my list. So I make this list to installing my fav apps in my fresh installed OS to make efficiency.

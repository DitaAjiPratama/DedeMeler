# DedeMeler

Debian Desktop Mein Installer. My personal fav apps installer.

When I had to reinstall my GNU/Linux OS, re-install my fav apps list is wasting the time. Sometimes, I forgetting some apps on my list. So I make this list to installing my fav apps in my fresh installed OS to make efficiency.

You can make your own too. This is just one of many sample to make your fav apps installer.
